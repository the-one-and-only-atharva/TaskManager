# TaskManager: Orbital Task Management System

A vibe coded task management application that transforms productivity through space-themed orbital interfaces.

Disclaimer: I just wanted to see for myself whether AI assisted progamming really works. You will find lots of bugs and issues, and frankly, some extremely stupid code. I will create another app like this one, but try to minimize my use of AI. Hopefully, that version is better written and more delightful to use.

## What Makes This Special?

TaskManager isn't just another todo app, it's an **interactive space adventure** for your productivity. Navigate through tasks as if you're exploring a solar system, with each task represented as a celestial body orbiting around your goals.

## Key Features

- **🌌 Orbital Task Visualization**: Tasks orbit around central themes like planets around a sun
- **🎯 Interactive 3D Canvas**: Drag, zoom, and pan through your task universe
- **⚡ Priority System**: Visual priority indicators with space-themed icons (meteor, asteroid, planet)
- **🔄 Status Tracking**: Monitor task progress through different orbital states
- **🎨 Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS
- **🎭 Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion powered interactions for delightful UX

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite for lightning-fast development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for beautiful, responsive design
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth, engaging interactions
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit for intuitive task management
